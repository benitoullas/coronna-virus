			<h3>What is COVID-19?</h3> 
			COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and
			‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’
			The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory
			Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.

			<h3>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h3> 
			Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause
			pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. These symptoms are similar to
			the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19. This is why testing
			is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19.

			<h3>What is the treatment for COVID-19?</h3> 
			There is no currently available vaccine for COVID-19. However, many of the symptoms can be treated
			and getting early care from a healthcare provider can make the disease less dangerous. There are
			several clinical trials that are being conducted to evaluate potential therapeutics for COVID-19.

			<h3>how does corona virus spread?</h3>
			The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
			<ul>	
				<li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
				<li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</li>
			</ul>
			These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

		<h3>How can we protect ourself?</h3>

			<li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Avoid close contact</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>

		</ul>
		<h3>How can we protect others?</h3>
		<h5>Stay home if you’re sick</h5>

If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li>

		<h3>Follow Five Steps to Wash Your Hands the Right Way</h3>
		<p>Washing your hands is easy, and it’s one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs. Clean hands can stop germs from spreading from one person to another and throughout an entire community—from your home and workplace to childcare facilities and hospitals.</p>

		<p><b>Follow these five steps every time.</b></p>
		<ol>

			<li>Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.</li>
			<li>Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.</li>
			<li>Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice.</li>
			<li>Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.</li>
			<li>Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.</li>
